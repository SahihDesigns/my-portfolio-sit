A break through happened today.
i was able to use  flex box to position my contact and about and position my main content
i created a color variable and made an auto layout using flex wraap.
i created a nice border for my about and contact and set the border radius. all this felt like an easier way to set up a responsive webpage, using cmponents, variables and autolayout
# ANOTHER BREAK THROUGH ALHAMDULILAH

targeted my nav bar.
used flexbox to space them
did a cool hover trick fto change the color of the contact background when one hovers their mouse over it.

#another step achieved
created a a purple span bacground element around the intro sentence name, "samira". customized it with border radius and padding.

moved things to a particular position with padding-right/left etc. created a significant amount of space between the header/nav bar and body.

added a char emoji to my intro paragraph
