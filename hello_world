A break through happened today.
i was able to use  flex box to position my contact and about and position my main content
i created a color variable and made an auto layout using flex wraap.
i created a nice border for my about and contact and set the border radius. all this felt like an easier way to set up a responsive webpage, using cmponents, variables and autolayout
# ANOTHER BREAK THROUGH ALHAMDULILAH

targeted my nav bar.
used flexbox to to space them
did a cool hover trick
